## A Star Pathfinding Algorithm

Attempt at implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the optimal path between two points in a 2D grid.

## Cube Wave by Bees and Bombs

Attempt recreate a 3D @beesandbombs GIF with p5.js and the WebGL renderer.

## Fractal Trees - Recursive

Attempt at implement fractal trees with recursion in p5.js.

## Maze Generator\

Using a stack and generating a maze using the Depth-First Search and Recursive algorithm.

## Snowfall

Attempt to create a snowfall simulation using p5.js, sprite sheets and Perlin noise wind

## Sudo Hilbert Curve

I attempt to animate the path of the classic "space filling curve" known as the Hilbert Curve.

## The Binary Search Tree (console only)

Here I attempt to implement a classic data structure: The Binary Search Tree.

## p5.js

This file stores the complete p5.js library. It is easy to read by humans, so feel free to open it and explore its contents. It also has a friendly error system, which helps new programmers with common user errors.

## p5.min.js

This file is a minified version of the p5.js file. It is a lighter version, with the same functionalities, but smaller file size. This minified version is harder to read for humans, and does not include the friendly error system.

## addons folder

The addons folder includes additional p5.js related libraries, in both original versions and minified versions.

### p5.sound.js, p5.sound.min.js

p5.sound extends p5.js with Web Audio functionality including audio input, playback, analysis, and synthesis.

## Starting Template

This is an empty example of a website. The folder includes the file for the website, index.html, the p5.js library, other related p5.js libraries, and a template starting point for your p5.js sketch, called sketch.js.

### index.html

index.html is a template for an HTML file. This index.html first imports the libraries included in the folder (p5.js, p5.sound.js) then loads and executes the file sketch.js which is where you can write your own code.

### sketch.js

The sketch.js is a template for the p5.js sketch, with the functions setup() and draw() that you can complete.

## README.txt

This README file formatted with Markdown :)
